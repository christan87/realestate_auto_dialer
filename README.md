# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `lt --port 3000`

exposes the backed server on port 3000 to the web so that the twilio route can make phone calls.

You will receive a url, for example 'https://gqgh.localtunnel.me' that you must supply as the value to the environment variable LOCAL_TUNNEL in the .env file in the root directory. This should be done BEFORE 'npm run dev' is run so that the app hass access to the correct environment variable at runtime.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in your browser.

launches the backend server on http://localhost:3000

**Note: This app has nodemon installed globaly in the root directory which is used to run the app and it also has localtunnel installed globally which is needed to expose port 3000 to the web. These packages may need to be installed on any machine that runs the app

**Note: The only call that can be is to my 'own' number because this is a trial account with twilio. For more information go to https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223180048-How-to-Add-and-Remove-a-Verified-Phone-Number-or-Caller-ID-with-Twilio 


<!-- ### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
